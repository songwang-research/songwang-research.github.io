Recently, I read a blog post by Dan Koe, published on December 24, 2025.  
Dan Koe is best known for his work on the concept of the *One-Person Business*.

This article articulated, in a clear and systematic way, an idea that my father once shared with me several years ago. In Chinese, this concept is often expressed as “屁股决定脑袋”, which can be translated literally as “one’s position determines one’s thinking.” At the time, my father explained this phrase by pointing to situations that were happening around him, illustrating how people’s roles, interests, and circumstances shaped the way they viewed the same issue. I understood the idea intuitively, but only at a surface level.

Dan Koe’s article revisited this concept with much greater structure and depth. It helped me see how an individual’s environment, incentives, and role fundamentally influence how they think, decide, and act. 

I am happy to share this article here and hope you find it thought-provoking as well.
